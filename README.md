# AppRails <br />
a. I have selected Rails as my server framework because of the faster development process and the powerful features. <br />
b. AngularJS is what I chose as my client framework because of its similarity to JavaScript which I am familiar with and the MVC architecture simplifies the things. <br />
c. The reading of JSON data using AJAX was easier. ($http.get) <br />
d. The Google Maps integration and the respective methods to use were not easy to implement. <br />
e. I have installed Heroku toolbelt for deploying the app on Heroku. Also, bower for the front end dependencies. <br />
f. Rails was installed using Ubuntu Terminal.<br />
   rails new apprails <br />
   rails generate controller home index <br />
   Navigate to the folder of the application created <br />
   rails s <br />
