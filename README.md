# AppRails
a. I have selected Rails as my server framework because of the faster development process and the powerful features.
b. AngularJS is what I chose as my client framework because of its similarity to JavaScript which I am familiar with and the MVC architecture simplifies the things.
c. The reading of JSON data using AJAX was easier. ($http.get)
d. The Google Maps integration and the respective methods to use were not easy to implement.
e. I have installed Heroku toolbelt for deploying the app on Heroku. Also, bower for the front end dependencies.
f. Rails was installed using Ubuntu Terminal.
